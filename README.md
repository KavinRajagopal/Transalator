# Transformerfromscrach

This repository contains the implementation of a Transformer model from scratch. The code is organized into the following files:

## dataset.py

The `dataset.py` file contains the code for loading and preprocessing the dataset. It provides functions for reading the input data, performing tokenization, and generating batches for training.

## model.py

The `model.py` file contains the implementation of the Transformer model. It defines the architecture of the model, including the encoder and decoder layers, attention mechanisms, and feed-forward networks. The file also includes functions for training and inference.

## train.py

The `train.py` file is used for training the Transformer model. It includes functions for initializing the model, defining the loss function and optimizer, and running the training loop. The file also provides options for saving and loading model checkpoints.

To use this code, you can follow the steps below:

1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Prepare your dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.
3. Modify the hyperparameters and other settings in the code if needed.
4. Run `python train.py` to start the training process.

Feel free to explore the code and make any modifications as per your requirements. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy coding!
